#Model Company

## Introduction
On September 1st, 1861, one hundred and two men reported to Camp Curtain, Harrisburg, to enlist in Company D of the 46th Pennslyvania Infantry. Some had just returned from service in regiments who served for three months over the summer - the amount of time the government had felt necesary to quelch the Southern rebellion which had started in April with the firing on Fort Sumpter, SC. But the Union Army's defeat at the Battle of First Manassas in July had proved that it would not be a short or easy process. The government called for the enlistement of [xxx] more soldiers, and the Pennsylvania residents - some veterans, some not - were some of the first to respond.

In the next four years, the men of Company D would find themselves struggling to suvive in now famous battles that we now know as Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and Bentonville, along with some lesser known names like Cedar Mountain and Peach Tree Creek where they lost 50% of their number wounded and killed in action. They would sweat through summers of long marches and poor food, and they would slog through winter mud and snow with too few shoes and clothing. More would join their ranks over the course of their service, but many of those original one hundred and two would return home mamed or not at all.

On paper the original 102 members of Company D, 46th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers looks ordinary. They were farmers, laborers, students and carpenters. Most were young. Through four years of service, they proved themselves to be brave, competent soldiers who withstood some of the most horrifying battles during a war that took the lives 600,000 Americans.

 After that war, historians researched and documented what they thought to be the "average" Civil War soldier. As recorded in <a href="https://archive.org/details/reglossescivilwar00foxwrich" target="_blank">Fox's Regimental Losses</a>, the soldier was most likely to be a 5'8 twenty-five year old with dark hair and blue eyes. He was most often a farmer with light complexion. If Company D appears to be a normal company, how do they compare to the national average? Are they the Model of a Civil War soldier - a model company?
 
## The Company

On enlistement, recruits were asked certain personal information - one of which was residence. Most of the members of Company D were from the various Townships of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.

## The Messes

When the Company was formed, the men were instructed to organize themselves in groups of about fifteen - referred to as "messes". These personally appointed and chosen groups would have resulted in the clustering of friends, neighbors, and family. Together, they would camp, cook, eat, and sleep.

## Out Method

Company and regimental officers tried to record the manner in which their men left the regiment - whether it be by expiration of enlistment, illness, disability, wounding, capture, or death. But sometimes men simply fell through the cracks of a military straining against its own size and loss of personnel from its ranks.

## Conclusion

After four years of service, the remaining members of Company D were "mustered out" of service on July 16th, 1865 at Alexandria, VA.
