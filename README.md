Company is a work in progress that, when finished, will allow visualization and comparison of personal traits and statistics - like height, age, occupation, and method of discharge - of a Civil War company of 100 men. It will also offer comparison of traits at the "mess" level - groupings of about 20 soldiers that were chosen by the men and often consisted of family, close friends and neighbors. This research, collected from private and unpublished 150 year old documents, is extraordinarily rare and will offer an unprecedented look into the physical and social traits of a "common" and hard fought Civil War regiment.
