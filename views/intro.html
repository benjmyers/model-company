    <p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n September 2nd, 1861, 91 recruits reported to Camp Curtain in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to enlist in the Union Army as Company D of the 46th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. Over the course of the next four years, they would fight in some of the most well-known campaigns of a war that took the lives of over 600,000 Americans.</p>
    <p>Over 150 years later, the story of these brave Pennsylvanians is little known, perhaps in part because they weren't exceptional. They were farmers, laborers, carpenters, and school boys. They were of modest means and lacked the fancy uniforms of some more famed regiments. And while they surely didn't suffer as severely as many others, they still saw their share of brutal hand-to-hand combat and long strenuous marches through mud, snow, and heat. Almost 20 percent of them didn't return home.</p>
    <p>After the war, statistics were compiled to define the <a href="http://www.civilwarhome.com/chapt7.html" target="_blank">average Union soldier</a>. He was most likely a 5'8 25-year-old with dark hair and blue eyes, and was often a farmer with a light complexion. But, in the same way the experiences of Company D and the 46th have been forgotten in favor of more well-known regiments, the typical soldier has been generalized to the point of obscuring the individual. That era and those who fought to preserve a struggling young democracy are reduced to pages in a text book.</p>
    <p>Using rarely available personal information, this group of 91 men becomes the model of a common Civil War soldier. They were friends, neighbors, brothers. They worked as farmers, carpenters, laborers, and printers. They had eyes and hair of every color; they looked much like modern Americans. This unprecendented look at their personal attributes brings us closer not only to the common Civil War soldier, but also to their humanity.
