    <p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n September 2nd, 1861, 102 recruits reported to Camp Curtain in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to enlist in the Union Army as Company D of the 46th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. Over the course of the next four years, they would fight in some of the most well known campaigns of a war that took the lives of over 600,000 Americans.</p>
    <p>Over 150 years later, the story of these brave Pennsylvanians is little known, perhaps in part because they weren't exceptional. They were farmers, laborers, carpenters, and school boys. They were of modest means and lacked the fancy uniforms of some more famed regiments. And while they surely didn't suffer as severely as many others, they still saw their share of brutal hand-to-hand combat and long forced marches through mud, snow, and heat. Almost 20 percent of them didn't return home.</p>
    <p>After the war, statistics were compiled to define the <a href="https://archive.org/details/reglossescivilwar00foxwrich" target="_blank">average Union soldier</a>. He was most likely a 5'8 twenty-five-year-old with dark hair and blue eyes, and was often a farmer with a light complexion. But, in the same way the experiences of Company D and the 46th have been forgotten in favor of more well-known regiments, the typical soldier has been generalized to the point of obscuring the individual. That era and those who fought to preserve a struggling young democracy are reduced to pages in a text book.</p>
    <p>Using rarely available personal information, this group of 102 men becomes the model of a common Civil War soldier. They were friends, neighbors, brothers. They worked in occupations that still exist or existed until not so long ago. They had eyes and hair of every color; they looked much like modern Americans. This unprecendented look at their personal attributes brings us closer not only to the common Civil War soldier, but also to their humanity.

   <!--  <p>On September 1st, 1861, one hundred and two men reported to Camp Curtain, Harrisburg, to enlist in Company D of the 46th Pennslyvania Infantry. Some had just returned from service in regiments who served for three months over the summer - the amount of time the government had felt necesary to quelch the Southern rebellion which had started in April with the firing on Fort Sumpter, SC. But the Union Army's defeat at the Battle of First Manassas in July had proved that it would not be a short or easy process. The government called for the enlistement of [xxx] more soldiers, and the Pennsylvania residents - some veterans, some not - were some of the first to respond.</p>

<p>In the next four years, the men of Company D would find themselves struggling to suvive in now famous battles that we now know as Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and Bentonville, along with some lesser known names like Cedar Mountain and Peach Tree Creek where they lost 50% of their number wounded and killed in action. They would sweat through summers of long marches and poor food, and they would slog through winter mud and snow with too few shoes and clothing. More would join their ranks over the course of their service, but many of those original one hundred and two would return home mamed or not at all.</p>

<p>On paper the original 102 members of Company D, 46th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers looks ordinary. They were farmers, laborers, students and carpenters. Most were young. Through four years of service, they proved themselves to be brave, competent soldiers who withstood some of the most horrifying battles during a war that took the lives 600,000 Americans.</p>

 <p>After that war, historians researched and documented what they thought to be the "average" Civil War soldier. As recorded in <a href="https://archive.org/details/reglossescivilwar00foxwrich" target="_blank">Fox's Regimental Losses</a>, the soldier was most likely to be a 5'8 twenty-five year old with dark hair and blue eyes. He was most often a farmer with light complexion. If Company D appears to be a normal company, how do they compare to the national average? Are they the Model of a Civil War soldier - a model company?
