    <p>Aware of the physical and mental conditions of what remained of the 46th, along with its Brigade and Corps, field commanders attempted to request time for rest and resupply for the men. But with the Confederates having badly out manuvered the Union since the spring, and yet another defeat suffered at Second Manassas, President Lincoln was increasingly nervous about the state of the war. The 46th wasn't allowed any rest, and while they did recieve new issues of uniforms and equipment, their depleated ranks remained in a desparate state. In early September intelligence arrived that Confederate Forces were heading northward toward Pennsylvania, and the 46th's Corps was dispatched to help stop the Confederate advance.</p>

    Some who were wounded at Cedar Mountain returned to the regiment at this time, knowing that it was in desparate need of men. George A Brooks, commanding Company D, was one of those men, along with the 46th's Colonel, Joseph Knipe. They arrived from their home of Harrisburg just in time to participate in what we now known as the Battle of Antietam, which occurred outside of the small town of Sharpsburg, MD. In the biggest battle the war had yet seen, 130,000 soldiers would engage in the bloodiest day in American history. 23,000 were killed in vicious combat, including Captian Brooks who was killed instantly while leading Company D onto the field. The battle is remembered by history as a tactical draw, but the Confederate army did withdraw back into Virginia for the remainder of 1862, and the Lincoln administration declared it a victory. Using the favorable social and political sentiment after the first "real victory" for the north, Lincoln delivered the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, freeing all slaves and giving moral focus to a war that would continue for over two long years <a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6" title="link to footnote">[6]</a>.

    <div class="picture-caption">55% of Union soliders had brown hair, and only 1% had gray hair, showing that it was indeed a young mans' war. The majority of Company D soliders also had brown hair. Two men had gray hair, and there was only one red head - William Beddleyoung, a 43 year old teamster from Dauphin County.</div>
