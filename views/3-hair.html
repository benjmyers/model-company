        Aware of the physical and mental condition of the 46th, along with its Brigade and Corps, field commanders requested time for rest and resupply for the men. But having been outmaneuvered by the Confederates since the spring, and suffering yet another defeat at Second Manassas, it was clear the Union wasn't winning the war. The 46th wasn't allowed any rest, and while they did receive new issues of uniforms and equipment, their depleted ranks remained in a desperate state. In early September, intelligence indicated that Confederate forces were heading northward toward Pennsylvania. The 46th Pennsylvania, having been reorganized into the XII Corps under the command of Major General Joseph K. Mansfield, was dispatched to help stop the Confederate advance.

        Due to the lack of men, some who were wounded at Cedar Mountain returned to the regiment before they were fully recovered. George A. Brooks, commanding Company D, was one of them, along with the 46th's Colonel, Joseph Knipe. They arrived from their homes in Harrisburg just in time to participate in the Battle of Antietam outside of the small town of Sharpsburg, Maryland. In the largest battle the war had yet seen, 130,000 soldiers would engage in the bloodiest day in American history. 23,000 soldiers were killed or wounded in vicious combat. Captain Brooks died instantly after being shot in the head while leading Company D onto the field.

        The battle is remembered by history as a tactical draw, but the Confederate army did retreat back into Virginia for the remainder of 1862, and the Lincoln administration declared it a victory. Using the favorable social and political sentiment after the first "real victory" for the North, Lincoln delivered the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/" target="_blank">Emancipation Proclamation</a>. The document freed all slaves under the premise that secession was illegal, and the Southern states were still under federal rule. Obviously, this was inconsequential in the South, however, it did fulfill its intended purpose: giving the Union moral focus to a war that was nowhere near its end [6].

    <div class="picture-caption">55 percent of Union soldiers had brown hair, and only 1 percent had gray hair, showing that it was indeed a young man's fight. The majority of Company D's soldiers also had brown hair. Two men had gray hair, and there was only one red head - William Beddleyoung, a 43 year old teamster from Dauphin County.</div>
