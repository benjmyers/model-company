        The 91 men of Company D, along with almost 900 others forming the ten companies of the 46th Pennsylvania, spent only two weeks organizing and training at Camp Curtain before they were rushed by train to defend Washington, D.C. All of them had volunteered for service, primarily because they felt it was their patriotic duty to end the "Southern rebellion". Regarded by President Lincoln's administration as an illegal act, the secession of the South was met with rage by northerners who were immediately eager to join up and restore the Union.

        Each company came from different regions, including many central Pennsylvanian counties and some Pittsburgh area counties on the western side of the state [1]. Company D's men were mostly from Harrisburg and the county in which it is located, Dauphin. At the time of the war, Harrisburg was an important center of industry through which many turnpikes, railroads, and canals crossed and intersected [2]. Its centrality made it an excellent location for the Union's largest training camp, and over the course of the four-year Civil War over 300,000 recruits would learn to be soldiers at Camp Curtain [3].

        A few men also enlisted in Company D from other areas, including a small group from Berks County, to the east of Harrisburg, one from the Pittsburgh area, and one from the northeastern part of the state. There was also a recent immigrant from Germany.

        While at Camp Curtain, the men provided identifying characteristics about themselves, such as height, age, hair, eye, and skin color. In a pre-dental record and dog tag era, these simple traits could be their only hope of identification if killed and not located by comrades.

        They also selected their "Messes" â€” groups of 15 to 20 soldiers that they organized themselves. This self-division leads to an interesting subset of the company since they would have selected friends, neighbors, and relatives. They would camp together, cook together, and sleep together. However, the military didn't keep records of who composed Messes, so the most personal subsets of companies were usually lost to time.

        The remainder of 1861 would have formed even stronger bonds between the "green" Messes of Pennsylvanians, who would travel 95 miles by foot as they marched north of the nation's capitol to deter Confederate operations. Although they were close to combat several times and marched past the wounded and dead after the battle of Ball's Bluff, they were never called into action. Instead, they learned much about the hardships of the soldiers' life on military campaign.

<div class="picture-caption">The Messes of Company D were made up of friends, neighbors, and family from the same home towns. The majority of Mess 1's men were from north of Harrisburg from the towns of Millersburg and New Buffalo. Almost all of Mess 2 was from Halifax. Messes 3 and 4 were from East and West Hanover Township. Mess 5 had a group of 5 men from Birdsboro, Berks County, and Mess 6 was composed of groups from Halifax, West Hanover Township, and Harrisburg.</div>
