        During the winter of 1863, the 46th and Company D recruited back at home to bolster their ranks as comrades slowly returned from the hospital. Meanwhile, their duties in the field continued. They weren't engaged in the defeat at Fredericksburg, Virginia, in December of 1862, but they manuvered with Union forces to try to outsmart Confederates under the skilled command of General Robert E. Lee. On the evening of January 20th, Union forces planned another march in an attempt to circle behind Lee's lines and form an attack. The march was supposed to take four hours, but the winter weather took a turn for the worse, and the men found themselves mired in impassable, muddy roads. Horses and artillery simply sunk, making them impossible to move. They continued for four days until it became clear the manuver, quickly dubbed the "Mud March," was a failure, and the army was ordered back to camp. A <em>New York Times</em> reporter recounted the grim scene left behind: "Horses and mules dropped down dead, exhausted with the effort to move their loads through the hideous medium. One hundred and fifty dead animals, many of them buried in the liquid muck, were counted in the course of a morning’s ride <a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7" title="link to footnote">[7]</a>.”

        The remainder of winter and early spring were comparatively quiet as Union commanders reorganized the army and tried to determine a strategy that would actually lead to a victory. To that end, on April 30th, 100,000 Union troops mobilized and advanced on Lee's 60,000 Confederates. The two armies met outside of Chancellorsville, Virginia, on May 1st. During the three-day battle that ensued, the 46th was again heavily engaged with General Jackson's forces. They fought well but their brigade had all of its commanding officers but one wounded, captured, or killed. The entire 46th was almost captured but the majority escaped. Some men and the regimental flag were lost <a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8" title="link to footnote">[8]</a>. John Kreiser of Company D, a 27-year-old laborer, was among one of the captured who was never heard from again. Major Strous, at the time in command of the 46th, was mortally wounded. It was yet another defeat for the Union army, and they would be given little time to recover <a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9" title="link to footnote">[9]</a>.

<div class="picture-caption">The majority of Union soldiers had a light complexion. Company D had a larger proportion of men with "dark" complexions, which at the time would have indicated a suntan instead of ethnicity. This is probably due to the nature of most of the men's work as farmers and laborers. Mess 1, with the highest percentage of farmers, also had the highest percentage of dark skinned individuals.</div>
