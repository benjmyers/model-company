        The 101 men of Company D, along with almost 900 others forming the ten companies of the 46th Pennsylvania spent only two weeks organizing and training at Camp Curtain before they were rushed by train on September 17th to defend Washington, DC. Each company hailed from different regions, including many central Pennsylvanian counties and some Pittsburgh area counties on the western side of the state <a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1" title="link to footnote">[1]</a>.

        Company D's men were primarily from Harrisburg and the county in which it is located, Dauphin. At the time of the war, the area was an important center of industry through which many turnpikes, railroads, and canals crossed and intersected <a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2" title="link to footnote">[2]</a>. Its centrality made it an excellent location for the Union's largest training camp, and over the course of the four year Civil War over 300,000 recruits would learn to be soliders at Camp Curtain <a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3" title="link to footnote">[3]</a>.

        A few men also enlisted from other areas, including a small group from Berks County, to the east of Harrisburg, one from the Pittsburgh area, one from the northeastern part of the state, and a recent immigrant from Germany.

        It was during this time that the men would've selected their "Messes" - groups of 15 to 20 soldiers that they organized themselves. This self division leads to an interesting subset of the company since they would have selected friends, neighbors, and relatives. They would camp together, cook together, and sleep together. However, the miliary didn't keep records of who composed messes, so the most personal subsets of companies were lost to time.

        The remainder of 1861 would have formed even stronger bonds between the "green" messes of Pennsylvanians, who would travel 95 miles by foot as they marched north of the Nation's Capitol to deter Confederate operations. Although they were close to combat several times and even witnessed the wounded and dead after the battle of Ball's Bluff, MD, they were never engaged, and instead learned much about the hardships of the soldiers' life on campaign.
