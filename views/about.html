  <h4>Model Company is</h4>
  <p>a unique look at a company of Civil War soldiers. On paper, Company D, 46th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers looks pretty ordinary. They were farmers, laborers, schoolboys and carpenters. Most were young. Through four years of service, proved themselves to be brave, competent soldiers who stood the test of some of the most horrifying battles during a war that took the lives of some 600,000 Americans. </p>

  <p>After that war, historians researched and documented what they thought to be the "average" Civil War soldier. As recorded in <a href="https://archive.org/details/reglossescivilwar00foxwrich" target="_blank">Fox's Regimental Losses</a>, the soldier was most likely to be a 5'8 twenty-five year old with dark hair and blue eyes. He was likely to be a farmer with light complexion. So just how does Company D compare? Was this "normal" group of soldiers actually what history has defined? Are they the Model of a Civil War soldier - a model company?</p>

  <p>What makes Model Company unique is the data set, compiled from various public and private collections during hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of research spanning five years' time. Records during the Civil War are well known to be faulty. Inaccurate, incomplete, and difficult to read, information and men fall through the cracks of time. Having so many details about soldiers on a company (about 100 men actively enlisted at any time) level is uncommon in and of itself, however documents discovered in a private collection make this data set truly unique. On those documents, men were split into "messes" - or the groups of about 15 men they divided themselves into. These subdivisions at the company level were not recorded or of interest to the government. Messes camped together, cooked together, and fought together. They were the smallest subset of a regiment's neighbors, friends, and brothers. Messes were uniquely personal, and they tell a story seldom heard. </p>

  <h4>Why does it matter?</h4>
  <p>The Civil War (1861-1865) seems like a long time ago. But it wasn't. Several children of Civil War soldiers still live. It is a time period that many have forgotten, yet is crucial to who we are as a people and a nation. Few of us could possibly imagine our country being ripped in half in a four year conflict fought within our nation that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands and left millions more maimed physically and mentally. We are fortunate we have the luxury to forget, but in doing so we lose a part of who we are. </p>

  <p>The Civil War can be easy to overlook because it was long enough ago that finding relevant information on the personal side of the war can be difficult to the modern person. What was the Civil War soldier like? What did he look like; where did he come from? Reading old muster rolls isn't viable to the average person. Looking at an interactive website that exposes patterns in the data is. That is what Model Company is attempting to do - to lessen the information divide between a digital and non-digital era, and in the process, make history relevant and accessible.</p>

  <h4>What's next?</h4>
  <p>Model Company is still in its infancy. At present, you are able to view statistics for a subset of the company - the subset for which mess number was available, which is a little less than 100 men. In the future, users will be able to view mess data alongside company data as a whole, including data about those men who were not enlisted at the time the mess lists were created (early May, 1862). Users will also be able to compare mess and company data against national averages.</p>

  <p>In addition, more relevant visualizations will be added. The data set will be improved and expanded. Eventually, users will be able to view information about the individual soldiers including service notes and photographs.</p>

  <h4>What crazed person did this?</h4>
  <p>The two great interests of my life are the Civil War and programming. This is the result of those interests. My great, great, great grandfather served in Company D, and named his son after Captain Brooks, who was killed in action at Antietam. While researching Company D for a book about Captain Brooks, I stumbled across the Mess lists and knew I had something special. This visualization was a step in the right direction for sharing information about a unit that receives little recognition in the history books. It also helps to answer the question that has driven me for years - who were these brave men?</p>
